# Welcome

Hi! :seedling: :cat:

I'm Valeria and I'm a software developer, public speaker and meetup organizer.

This is my very first personal website and I will use it as a place to share my projects, recordings of my talks and slides and so on.

To build this website I'm using Jekyll, a static site generator, and the Cayman theme. I'm also using GitHub Pages to host it.

I mainly used the following official resources:
- [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

## How to use this website locally

If you already have Ruby and Jekyll installed on your computer, you can clone this repository and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to see the website locally at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Some useful commands

Even though a lot of documentation is available online, I recommend to take in consideration mainly the following commands:

- `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the website locally
- `bundle info jekyll-theme-cayman` to get information about the Cayman theme (mainly the path where it is installed so you can copy the layouts and styles)
- `bundle install` to install the gems specified in the Gemfile
- `bundle update` to update the gems specified in the Gemfile
- `gem install <name_theme>` to install a new theme
