# About me

I always describe myself as someone with a hybrid background and too many interests.

My passion for technology ignited in my early years, when I'd toggle between a soccer ball and a "toy" PC, oblivious to the concept of programming. 
In the end, I chose the latter path, I studied computer technology at school, I enrolled in Music Information Technology at University and during those years I discovered web development.
I started off as a backend developer but then I switched to the dark side (front end, obviously).

Along this journey, a particular sensibility lead me to become passionate about **accessibility** and **sustainability**.

Although being an introvert, in 2022 I discovered a passion for public speaking and I started to share my knowledge and experiences at conferences and meetups.

I'm proudly part of the **CNCF TAG Environmental Sustainability** and Technical Lead for the WG Sustainability Advocacy.
